# Book Data Wireframe Project

## Link To The Wireframe Followed
[Book Data Wireframe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSTUPyUdaRBmQBlmpUsv1YWlINbYRDkVSZsIV7Qgrm7xFGEj_I6pCqSmPEMAuOqZmk7kXX9PO2aMhqf/pub)

## Assumptions and Notes
- assumed the highest book count served as the maximum for the data bar
- did not attempt exact font or padding/margin styles but attempted to follow the basic structure of the wireframe
- assumed the border represents the screen
- assumed missing end bracket of the rows array was a typo
- chose not to use state for the JSON object because currently we are only displaying the values, not updating
- assumed desktop view for matching wireframe
- could be improved with Typescript
